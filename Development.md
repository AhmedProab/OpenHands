# Development Guide

This guide is intended for developers working on the OpenHands project. It provides a detailed overview of model integration strategies, cost optimization techniques, batch processing configurations, and smart alerts. By following these guidelines, you can enhance performance, reduce costs, and efficiently manage resources.

## Model Integration Types and Strategies

OpenHands supports multiple strategies for integrating models. Each mode is optimized for specific workloads, resource constraints, and performance goals. Selecting the appropriate mode ensures that you leverage the right model(s) for your tasks, whether you rely on a single reliable model, multiple specialized models, or a hybrid approach.

### Single Agent Mode

**Description:**  
Uses a single, powerful model for all tasks, simplifying resource management and operational complexity.

**Default Model:**  
- `qwen2.5-coder:32b` (19GB)

**Suitable For:**  
- Consistent output quality  
- Simplified resource management  
- Reduced system overhead

**Configuration (TOML):**
```toml
mode = "single"
default_model = "qwen2.5-coder:32b"
batch_processing = true
```

### Multi Agent Mode

**Description:**  
Distributes tasks across multiple specialized models. Each model is optimized for different types of tasks, such as complex reasoning, code generation, or quick validation.

**Supported Models:**  
- `llama3.3` (42GB) â€“ Complex reasoning & code generation  
- `gemma:7b` (5.0GB) â€“ General tasks & documentation  
- `gemma:2b` (1.7GB) â€“ Fast responses & validation

**Suitable For:**  
- Optimizing specialized tasks  
- Parallel processing  
- Efficient resource utilization

**Configuration (TOML):**
```toml
mode = "multi"
models = ["llama3.3", "gemma:7b", "gemma:2b"]
task_routing = "automatic"
```

### Hybrid Mode

**Description:**  
Combines the advantages of both single and multi-agent approaches. The system intelligently selects the best model for each task based on complexity, resource availability, and performance requirements.

**Adaptive Model Selection Based On:**  
- Task complexity  
- Resource availability  
- Performance requirements  
- Cost optimization

**Key Features:**  
- Dynamic load balancing  
- Intelligent batch processing  
- Automatic failover

**Configuration (TOML):**
```toml
mode = "hybrid"
primary_model = "qwen2.5-coder:32b"
fallback_models = ["gemma:7b", "gemma:2b"]
cost_optimization = true
```

## Cost Optimization and Batch Processing

This section outlines strategies for reducing costs, optimizing token usage, and efficiently handling large volumes of requests. It also provides insights into enabling batch processing, which groups similar requests for higher throughput and reduced overhead.

### Batch Processing Integration

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automatic Batch Handling:** Groups similar requests and processes them together.  
- **Higher Throughput:** Handles up to 50 requests per batch.  
- **Reduced API Calls:** Potentially decreases API calls by up to 60%.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Improves overall performance and reduces overhead.

**Configuration Example (TOML):**
```toml
[batch_processing]
enabled = true
max_batch_size = 50
batch_timeout = "100ms"
auto_scaling = true
```

Enabling batch processing helps aggregate similar requests, minimizing redundant operations and improving response times.

### Cost Management Features

**Token Utilization:**
- **Intelligent Context Management:** Dynamically adjusts context windows to reduce unnecessary token usage.
- **Automatic Token Compression:** Compresses tokens to maximize effective use of context.
- **Response Caching:** Stores frequently requested responses to reduce repetitive computation.
- **Cost Savings:** Achieve up to a 40% reduction in token usage, lowering operational costs.

## Smart Optimization Alerts

OpenHands provides proactive alerts that analyze usage patterns, detect inefficiencies, and suggest optimizations. These alerts guide you in applying features like batch processing or adjusting configurations to maximize performance and cost-efficiency.

**Example Configuration (TOML):**
```toml
[optimization_alerts]
batch_processing_detection = true
cost_alerts = true
performance_monitoring = true
```

**Illustrative Alert Messages:**
- **High Similarity Detected:**  
  "A large number of similar requests have been detected. Consider enabling batch processing to improve efficiency."
- **Potential Cost Reduction:**  
  "You could save approximately 40% in token usage by utilizing batch processing for your current workload."
- **Performance Enhancement:**  
  "Resource usage patterns suggest that batching requests could significantly boost performance."

**Additional Examples:**
- **Significant Similar Request Volume:**  
  "A large number of similar requests has been detected â€” enabling batch processing is recommended."
- **45% Potential Savings:**  
  "Enabling batch processing for your current workload could yield approximately 45% cost savings."
- **Resource Usage Pattern Indicates Improvement:**  
  "Current resource usage suggests that batch processing would enhance overall performance."

**Interactive Alert Example:**
```
ðŸ’¡ An optimization opportunity has been detected:
- Currently: 100 separate API requests
- Potential grouping: 5 combined batches
- Estimated cost savings: ~35%
- Performance improvement: ~60%

Would you like to enable batch processing? [Y/n]
```

By following these recommendations and monitoring the provided alerts, you can continuously improve efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness.

## Conclusion

The OpenHands Development Guide equips you with strategies and configurations to tailor model integration, optimize costs, manage tokens, and streamline batch processing. Combined with smart alerts, these tools enable you to maintain a scalable, high-performance environment that adapts to evolving workloads and requirements.
